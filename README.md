Light bender is a DIY Laser board game

Light bender is a board game i made using a Red, Green & Blue laser.

The idea is to use mirror's to route the laser beam to a target.

See it in action over on Youtube: https://youtu.be/ifkgCdoMrVc

There are 9 red-green-blue LED's placed around the play field, each with an accompanying light sensor.

The game starts by triggering the proximity sensor at the top of the board and a random LED will light up a random colour.
The same coloured laser also turns on and the clock is started at 20 seconds.
When you complete the beam path to it's target, the next colour & laser is randomly selected. The remaining time on the clock adds to your score.

Past level 15 the time to solve each level is reduced. Eventually to 6 seconds.
Failing to solve the puzzle in the time limit will end the game.

Parts used...

1x Green laser pointer

1x Red laser pointer

1x Blue laser pointer

9x WS2812 RGB LED

9x Light dependent resistor

1x proximity sensor

1x OLED display

1x Speaker

1x Arduino Mega2560 Mini

3x BD135 transistor


The top clear acrylic and lower ply pieces where cut using a laser cutter (K40).
I used a vinyl cutter to cut the black and white decals placed under the clear acrylic.
And finally i 3d printed the laser mounts and covers to complete the game.
